Problem Description
-------------------

A call center has multiple clients. Some contracts require a number of dedicated staff per shift while others pay-per-minute.  The manager needs a scheduling system that will alert them when there are not enough people scheduled to a shift.  Administrator access would allow them to approve requests to switch shifts or take off, to view emergency contact information for employees, and would provide a report of hours required by clients vs. hours covered after adjusting settings for days that veer from the usual requirements, i.e. less staff on holidays and weekends.
